release_summary: |
  This release adds support for orchestrating a Prometheus exporter alongside the Palworld Dedicated Server.

  Enable it by setting ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_enable`` to ``true``, and configure the bind IP address and port with ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_bind_address`` (defaults to ``0.0.0.0``) and ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_bind_port`` (defaults to ``9877``).

  This is a major version upgrade as unfortunately a number of breaking changes were required in this release. In the future the necessity of major version releases like this should decrease.

breaking_changes:
  - The ``palworld_dedicated_server_public_port`` inventory variable has been renamed to ``palworld_dedicated_server_bind_port``.
  - The ``palworld_dedicated_server_rcon_port`` inventory variable has been renamed to ``palworld_dedicated_server_rcon_bind_port``.
  - >-
    The Palworld server admin password is now set in the ``palworld_dedicated_server_admin_password`` inventory variable.
    It can no longer be defined by setting ``ADMIN_PASSWORD`` in ``palworld_dedicated_server_settings`` (this value will now be ignored).

major_changes:
  - >-
    Add support for orchestrating the `bostrt/palworld-exporter <https://hub.docker.com/r/bostrt/palworld-exporter>`_
    Prometheus exporter, `developed by palworld.lol <https://github.com/palworldlol/palworld-exporter>`_,
    alongside Palworld Dedicated Server.

minor_changes:
  - >-
    The Palworld Dedicated Server's bind address for external access is now configurable using
    ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_bind_address``, which defaults to ``0.0.0.0``.

bugfixes:
  - Fix syntax errors in the compose file causing the service start to error out when RCON is enabled.

trivial:
  - >-
    Palworld will now be configured to always have RCON enabled internally. This for both local RCON CLI command access and enabling the Prometheus exporter.
    When ``palworld_dedicated_server_rcon_enable`` is set to ``false``, external access to this endpoint is disabled, as it did previously.
  - Add test job for building the Ansible Galaxy package (`#10 <https://github.com/Callum027/ansible-collection-palworld-dedicated-server/pull/10>`_)
  - Add support for the Palworld Prometheus exporter (`#11 <https://github.com/Callum027/ansible-collection-palworld-dedicated-server/pull/11>`_)
