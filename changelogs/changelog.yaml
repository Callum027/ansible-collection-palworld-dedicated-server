      breaking_changes:
      - The Palworld server admin password is now set in the ``palworld_dedicated_server_admin_password``
        inventory variable. It can no longer be defined by setting ``ADMIN_PASSWORD``
        in ``palworld_dedicated_server_settings`` (this value will now be ignored).
      - The ``palworld_dedicated_server_public_port`` inventory variable has been
        renamed to ``palworld_dedicated_server_bind_port``.
      - The ``palworld_dedicated_server_rcon_port`` inventory variable has been renamed
        to ``palworld_dedicated_server_rcon_bind_port``.
      bugfixes:
      - Fix syntax errors in the compose file causing the service start to error out
        when RCON is enabled.
      major_changes:
      - Add support for orchestrating the `bostrt/palworld-exporter <https://hub.docker.com/r/bostrt/palworld-exporter>`_
        Prometheus exporter, `developed by palworld.lol <https://github.com/palworldlol/palworld-exporter>`_,
        alongside Palworld Dedicated Server.
      minor_changes:
      - The Palworld Dedicated Server's bind address for external access is now configurable
        using ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_bind_address``, which defaults
        to ``0.0.0.0``.
      release_summary: 'This release adds support for orchestrating a Prometheus exporter
        alongside the Palworld Dedicated Server.


        Enable it by setting ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_enable`` to ``true``,
        and configure the bind IP address and port with ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_bind_address``
        (defaults to ``0.0.0.0``) and ``palworld_dedicated_server_exporter_bind_port``
        (defaults to ``9877``).


        This is a major version upgrade as unfortunately a number of breaking changes
        were required in this release. In the future the necessity of major version
        releases like this should decrease.
